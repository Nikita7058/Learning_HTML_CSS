<p class=" b_properties ">"My coding journey has been an exciting path of continuous learning and growth. From mastering the basics of Java, MySQL, HTML, and CSS to exploring advanced concepts in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, each step has expanded
    my knowledge. Working on projects like an autonomous robot using Arduino and IoT-based systems has strengthened my problem-solving skills. As I dive deeper into big data analytics, cloud computing, and business intelligence, I look forward to building
    innovative solutions that make a real impact! "</p>
