        In CSS, **Position Theory** refers to the different positioning methods used to control the placement of elements on a webpage. The `position` property defines how an element is positioned in the document. The five main values of the `position` property
        are: ### 1. **Static (Default)** - The default positioning of an element. - Elements appear in the normal document flow. - No special positioning is applied. ```css div { position: static; } ``` ### 2. **Relative** - The element is positioned
        relative to its **normal position**. - You can use `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to move it. ```css div { position: relative; top: 20px; left: 10px; } ``` ### 3. **Absolute** - The element is removed from the normal document flow. - It
        is positioned **relative to the nearest positioned ancestor** (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`). If no ancestor has a position, it defaults to the ` ` element. ```css div { position: absolute; top: 50px; left: 30px; } ``` ### 4. **Fixed**
        - The element is removed from the normal document flow. - It is positioned **relative to the viewport**, meaning it stays in the same position even when scrolling. ```css div { position: fixed; bottom: 10px; right: 10px; } ``` ### 5. **Sticky**
        - The element switches between `relative` and `fixed` based on the scroll position. - It sticks to the specified position when scrolling, but only within its parent container. ```css div { position: sticky; top: 20px; } ``` ### **Comparison of
        Positioning Methods** | Position | Affects Document Flow? | Moves with Scroll? | Relative To | |-----------|------------------------|--------------------|-------------| | `static` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | Default Flow | | `relative`| ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
        Its Normal Position | | `absolute`| ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | Nearest Positioned Ancestor (or ` ` if none) | | `fixed` | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | Viewport | | `sticky` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (when stuck) | Nearest Scrollable Ancestor | Let me know if you need a practical example!
