            Space is the vast, nearly empty area beyond Earth's atmosphere, containing celestial bodies like planets, stars, galaxies, and asteroids, and is a vacuum with extremely low pressure. 
Here's a more detailed look at space:
What is Space?
Definition:
Space refers to the expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere, encompassing everything outside our planet. 
Vacuum:
Space is a near-perfect vacuum, meaning it contains very little matter and has extremely low pressure. 
Composition:
While seemingly empty, space contains bits of gas, dust, and other matter, as well as celestial bodies like planets, stars, and galaxies. 
Kármán Line:
The boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space is often considered to be the Kármán line, an imaginary line 62 miles (100 kilometers) above sea level. 
Temperature:
The baseline temperature of outer space is set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, which is 2.7 kelvins (-270 °C; -455 °F). 
Key Features of Space:
Celestial Bodies:
Space contains a vast array of celestial bodies, including:
Planets: Our solar system has eight planets, and many other planets exist in other solar systems. 
Stars: Stars are massive, luminous balls of gas, like our Sun, and are the building blocks of galaxies. 
Galaxies: Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, and dust, held together by gravity. 
Asteroids: Rocky or metallic objects that orbit the Sun, often found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. 
Comets: Icy bodies that release gas and dust as they approach the Sun, forming a visible tail. 
Space Exploration:
Scientists and space agencies are constantly exploring and studying space through robotic probes, satellites, and manned missions. 
Milky Way Galaxy:
Our solar system is located in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy, called the Orion Spur. 
Universe Expansion:
The universe is observed to be 13.8 billion years old and has been expanding since its formation in the Big Bang. 
Space Junk:
There are also many pieces of space junk, including fragments from rockets and satellites, and everyday items like spanners dropped during construction of the International Space Station.
